# Print Layout
## A small utility to help solve the problem of resizing when printing an image

When printing an image to place somewhere, you usually want to be able to control the size at which it will be printed. However unfortuantely most of the time when you select print on an image, you will be prompted with a screen which only allows you a few pre-defined sizes, however they are not very customizable. 

This utility will allow you to quickly import 1 or more photos, and view their layout and size on a sheet of A4 (or another sized) Paper, this helps you visualize how large the photo will actually be when you print it, and eliminates the need to take the image into a much larger image/document editing program. For example many people will take the image to Microsoft Word or Adobe Photoshop, just to do a simple crop or resize, which should not be needed just to print out an image.

I am planning to add a mobile app, since it is even harder for a user to change an image's size there, however first I will create a website.\
Here are a few links to handle the 'Open With' feature of iOS:

## Design
I want this app to be very minimal and fast, so the design is meant to look very clean. For example I'll try to only keep a few buttons in sight, the pan and zoom will just be control by mouse/gesture and scroll/pinch for desktop/mobile.

Here is a design made in Figma:
