    <h1>An app designed to make it easy to layout and print images of different sizes</h1>

    <h2>When you open the app, you will have a blank canvas.</h2>

    <h2>You can import an image by clicking the + icon, then importing using your selected method (paste, camera, gallery). Then you should be able to resize and move the image by dragging on it.</h2>

    <h2>Finally when you are finished you can click the print button in the top-right, and it will open a print menu, you should ideally choose A4 size since that is what the app was designed for.</h2>

    <h2>This app requires an internet connection.</h2>
