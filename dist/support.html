    <h1>Print Layout Support</h1>
    
    <h2>What is Print Layout</h2>
    <p>An app designed to make it easy to layout and print images of different sizes</p>

    <h2>How to use</h2>
    <p>When you open the app, you will have a blank canvas.</p>

    <p>You can import an image by clicking the + icon, then importing using your selected method (paste, camera, gallery). Then you should be able to resize and move the image by dragging on it.</p>

    <p>Finally when you are finished you can click the print button in the top-right, and it will open a print menu, you should ideally choose A4 size since that is what the app was designed for.</p>

    <h2><i>This app requires an internet connection.</i></h2>
